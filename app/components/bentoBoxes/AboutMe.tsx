      <section>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer and a current student at the University of
          Houston, with a strong passion for web development, which I have
          pursued through various open-source projects. My journey as a
          first-generation immigrant has instilled in me a robust work ethic and
          a relentless drive to succeed. This unique background has shaped my
          determination and resilience, enabling me to overcome challenges and
          thrive in both my academic and professional endeavors.
