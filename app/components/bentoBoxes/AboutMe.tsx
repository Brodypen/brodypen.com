        <p>
          Originally a software engineer that later developed a strong creative
          side. I&apos;ve worked professionally in the web and video game
          industry for over 10 years, utilizing advanced 3D and motion graphics
          to deliver magical experiences to millions of people. I find myself
          positioned between product, design, and engineering; leading the
          development of cutting-edge projects.
